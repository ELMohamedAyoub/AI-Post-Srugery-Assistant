Project Overview
Objective
We are building a Reinforcement Learning (RL) chatbot assistant for post-surgery rehabilitation patients. The chatbot will provide:

Medication Reminders: Notify patients about taking their prescribed medications.
Emotional Support: Offer motivational messages to boost the patient’s mood.
Appointment Reminders: Inform patients about upcoming medical appointments.
FAQ Answers: Provide answers to frequently asked questions (e.g., knee surgery recovery).
Phase 1: Terminal-Based Chatbot
We will first create a basic version of the chatbot that runs in the terminal. This version will use RL to adapt and improve responses based on patient interactions.

Phase 2: Flask Web Application
Once the terminal version is complete, we will extend it to a Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface.

Steps to Build the Terminal-Based Chatbot
1. Define the Project Environment
Simulate the interaction as an environment where:
State Variables: Represent the patient's mood, medication adherence, and engagement level.
Actions: Represent the chatbot's possible responses (e.g., medication reminder, emotional support).
2. Build the RL Agent
Use a simple RL algorithm like Q-Learning:
The agent will learn the best actions to take based on the patient's current state.
A Q-table will store the agent's learned behavior.
3. Train the Chatbot
Train the RL agent using simulated patient responses to ensure the chatbot adapts and improves over time.
4. Build a Terminal-Based Interface
Create a simple terminal interface to allow patients to interact with the chatbot.
Simulate user feedback (e.g., "How do you feel?") to update the chatbot's state.
Project Requirements
Technical Requirements
Programming Language: Python 3.8 or above
Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations.
pytest for testing (optional but recommended).
Development Environment:
Use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or Conda) to manage dependencies.
File Structure
We will organize the project as follows:

Development Steps
Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install numpy
```
Define the RL Environment

Create a class RehabEnv to simulate the patient's recovery state and define possible actions the chatbot can take.
Build the RL Agent

Develop a RLAgent class to implement Q-learning logic.
Train the Agent

Write a train_agent.py script to train the RL agent in the environment.
Create the Terminal Interface

Develop a terminal_chatbot.py script to enable user interaction with the chatbot.
Test and Debug

Test the agent and environment for logical errors.
Adjust reward mechanisms and actions to better suit patient scenarios.
